question 6

##what is the average calories of all drinks?

```{r}
average_cals <- drinks_content %>% 
  summarise(mean_calories = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  pull()

drinks_content %>% 
  pull(Calories) %>% 
  mean()
```

both do the same thing but top one more typical

can now assign the top one too an object which gives the average cals for all drinks


##create summary table that shows the average calories for each prep type

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  group_by(Beverage_prep) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cals = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  
  ##filter data to show only beverage prep types with more than the avg number 
  ## of calories for all drinks
  filter(mean_cals > average_cals) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_cals))
```
