This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
drinks_content


```
question 1: Load in the dataset and have a look at it. What are the dimensions, variable types, variable names, etc.?

```{r}
dim(drinks_content)
names(drinks_content)
typeof(drinks_content)
summary(drinks_content)
```
Let’s first investigate the calories of different drinks. Select the variables Beverage_category, Beverage, Beverage prep and Calories from your data. Since we are interested in the calorie content, check if there are any NA values in the data, and drop them if there are.

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage_category, Beverage, Beverage_prep, Calories) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Calories))
```

Create a new variable (column) called calorie_diff, which stores the difference between 135 calories (135 calories = 10 cubes of sugar!) and the calories in each drink. (hint: you’ll want to subtract 135 from the calories to see which drink have more or less than 10 cups of sugar).

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage_category, Beverage, Beverage_prep, Calories) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Calories)) %>% 
  mutate(calorie_diff = Calories - 135)
```

question 4: Summarise the mean number of calories in each beverage_category. Which 3 category of drinks have the most calories? Which 3 drinks have the least? Write a small summary of your findings.

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage_category, Beverage, Beverage_prep, Calories) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Calories)) %>% 
  group_by(Beverage_category) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cals = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_cals))
  
```
The drinks with the top three mean calories are Smoothies (282.2222), Frappuccino (276.9444)
and signature espresso (250.000). The drinks with the three smallest are coffee (4.25),
shaken iced beverages (114.4444) and classic espresso drinks (140.1724)

question 5: Let’s look at this a different way. What is the average number of calories in each Beverage_prep type?

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage_category, Beverage, Beverage_prep, Calories) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Calories)) %>% 
  group_by(Beverage_prep) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cals_prep = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_cals_prep))
  
```



question 6: Which Beverage_prep type contains more than the average calories of all drinks?
 to answer this, you’ll have to first figure out what the average calories across all drinks are, and then use that as a filter for the grouped Beverage_prep data.

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Calories, Beverage_prep) %>% 
  mutate(average_cal = mean(Calories, na.rm = TRUE)) 

```


```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Calories) %>% 
  summarise(mean(Calories, na.rm = TRUE))
 
```

question 7: Which is the best type of coffee drink (and by ‘drink’ we mean the combination of Beverage_category, Beverage and Beverage_prep) to get if you’re worried about consuming too many calories?

```{r}
drinks_content
```
The best drink to get would be a short brewed coffee.
